# Stop Nearby
We made a web app where you can find the closest empty parking spot. Simple and easy to use.

Using HTML5 and JavaScript, we managed to develop a web app which shows all the parking spots in an area using Google Maps SDK. With just a click on a button, the app shows the driving route from your current position to the closest empty parking spot.

To determine whether a parking spot is empty or not, we want to use an Arduino with an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) which checks if there is anything in front of it at 0.5m. We're puting it near a parking spot and when a car is parked near it, the sensor will change the status of that parking spot in the app.

Our team has only 2 members: me (Marc Vana) and my collegue Mihai Marcu. We are both in 10th grade, in highschool, and we are very passionate about programming.
